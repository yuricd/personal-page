              <p>Hi, my name is Yuri Delgado and I'm a Brazilian web developer.</p>
              <p>I was born in Guarulhos, SP, and I'm currently living in Campinas, SP.</p>
              <p>I started making little web pages when I was about eight years old at school. During my high school I've done some jobs for an advertisement agency as web developer. At the same time I was taking a web design course.</p>

              <p>In 2012 I finished the computer technician course and, right after finishing high school, I was accepted in State University of Campinas (Unicamp), in 2014, when I started my Computer Science Bachelor's degree. During the undergraduation I worked as a freelancer web dev and on the second year I was hired to work in an intelligence and technology company, also as web dev.</p>

              <p>Nowadays, I work as full stack web developer. I like to plan, mock and build responsives UIs too.</p>
